TaleTime is an interactive audiobook app for iOS and Android.

<br>

**TaleTime** is an innovative app for Android and iOS, that lets children experience a new unique way of listening to audiobooks.

Besides our professionally recorded audiobooks we also give parents the opportunity to record the stories themselves. Recording is very convenient and of course can be done without extensive technical know-how. TaleTime also offers children the opportunity to influence the course of the stories themselves.

## Roadmap

Of course this project is not finished. There are several features that we still want to realize.
For this we designed a special [roadmap](https://www.github.com/TaleTime/TaleTime/projects/1).
You can head over there and have a look at all the open issues and start developing on a feature
of your interest right away.


## About us

This project was developed by several students of [Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Saar](http://www.htwsaar.de 'HTW Saar Homepage').
It has been in continous development for two years and now finally we want to take advantage of the huge
open source community of github.
